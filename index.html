    style="padding-right: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px" width="250" height="187">I got a Redbox
    machine as they were going out of business. They were disposing of them from businesses
    like Walmart, Walgreens, etc. and I happened to catch one right as it was going out. The
    guy taking it offered me four Redbox machines, of which I took one and my friend took
    another. His was blue, because it was at Walmart and they required blue ones at a certain
    point. Mine was also from Walmart but must have been before that requirement.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The machine still works 95%. You can rent
    movies (for free now) and return them. The maintenance menus are also accessible fairly
    easily. The only thing that doesn't seem to work is anything tied to their home servers
    (that don't exist now) such as the rewards programs. Not a huge loss there. With some
    modifications, the Redbox Tinkering <img src="Img_3974.jpg"

    style="padding-right: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px" width="250" height="333">discord group has
    been able to bypass the card scanner altogether, change the rent limit from 3 to 5, add
    back the option to buy movies, bring back the games rental options, and more. I believe I
    was the first to discover permanent dark mode for the UI.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">Almost every Redbox machine was running a
    version of Windows 7 with almost no features except for the Redbox programming. There was
    one or two people that were able to find Redbox machines running a Windows 10 version,
    which was only in a handful of machines before they went bankrupt. One person was actually
    able to get the computer inside, and download the operating system to share it. My machine
    has both the Windows 7 and Windows 10 versions running on it, though I primarily use the
    Windows 7 version. It messes up the inventory when you rent from one and switch to the
    other.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">It was also discovered how to add in custom
    movies to the lineup, add custom barcodes, and be able to rent/buy them. I know some were
    trying to add their whole movie collections to the machine, and I plan to eventually, but
    I only got so far as to add a custom movie and make it rentable. It is a long process that
    I might write up how to do it if you have your own machine.</font></td>

    style="padding-right: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px" width="250" height="187">A cyberdeck is a
    portable computer designed to survive in a post-apocalyptic scenario. I don't expect to be
    in one, so I just wanted to make a dope laptop. I bought a tough carrying case from a
    literal traveling salesman in St. Paul. It's branded Motorola, has strong clips, and has
    an airtight seal that I believe is rated IP68. It could be fully submerged in water and
    survive.The inside is a Toshiba Satellite L745 from early 2010's. Not high powered at all,
    but it's what I had. I will likely upgrade in the future. Shown in the picture is the
    motherboard, original hard drive, and original screen gorilla-taped to the top part of the
    case, with the PC running Linux Mint.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">This project is not complete as of 3/7/25. I
    have a ways to go, which involves me learning 3D printing. The idea for this cyberdeck is
    to have a portable data recovery/PC repair workstation. It will have HDMI and VGA in to
    the display to test computers with no video output/laptops with broken screens. It will
    have a hard drive slot to test SATA hard drives to recover files in case the computer is a
    loss. It'll have compartments for necessary cables, and hopefully I can fit the full
    charging situation inside instead of needing to carry a separate adapter outside of it.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">My future plans for finishing it are to get
    an SSD for faster booting, and dual boot Linux Mint and Tiny10. Eventually upgrade with a
    more modern laptop, preferably a free one, or one heavily discounted for a broken screen
    possibly. A mini PC would also work (Latte Panda-type deal). I'll need to design and print
    the interior casing to separate the motherboard from the keyboard/mouse and make it safer
    to be around. I have an LCD display from an iPad 4 that I plan to use for the screen, so
    I'll need a display board to make it work. Leave slots for a USB hub, video inputs, etc.
    It'll be a while because it's a more involved/expensive project, but not too expensive. I
    have a problem with spending money on my projects, trying to do it as free/cheap as
    possible. I'll finish this one day I prawmise.</font></td>

    Harrison (not pictured) and I built an arcade machine from scratch using a free 27&quot;
    CRT TV from Facebook, hardboard and 2x4's from Home Depot, buttons from China, and an old
    tower PC running Batocera Linux. Because it runs off a PC, we can put any games we'd like
    onto it, as long as our buttons and joysticks can use it. Obvious additions were actual
    arcade games like Simpsons, Space Invaders, Tapper, Pac-Man, etc. as well as classics like
    Super Mario Bros, Tetris, and Crazy Taxi.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">It has been working for a while, however I
    haven't put it all back together after moving it into our apartment, so currently it isn't
    functional. That's why the picture shows my other brother-in-law Justin playing the games
    on a monitor attached to it. Future plans to keep it working is to finally install the
    side door, which I need piano hinges to attach it. That should make accessing the
    internals much easier than unscrewing plywood. There seems to be an interference issue
    somewhere in the actual TV that makes it look wavy regardless of where it's plugged in,
    what's plugged into it, or what video it's showing. I may fix that, but I don't fully know
    what I'm doing there.</font></td>

    designing logos for many years. Quite a few have been used by businesses, family members,

    design, and it's been nice to be able to create or recreate something if I like a certain
    idea.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">When it comes to logos, I do like some more
    modern styles that are somewhat simple, but I feel I like more complicated works more,
    ones with character. I'm not fully there, so a lot of my logos are simple. I'll have more
    examples posted on the Music/Art page.</font></p>

    is my graffiti tag that I designed, which I have not vandalized anything with. If I did I
    wouldn't put my face on this site. I like the look of graffiti and wanted to try something
    out. I haven't gone too far but hopefully I can learn some more. My main goal with the art
    is to make hoodies/t-shirts/hats with it. I have one hoodie with this design that is
    fading real bad. One day I'll get it reprinted, or redesign it.</font></p>
